    <h3><a id="02">LAB 02: CSS Color & Text Lab</a></h3>
    <br><p class = "sideparagraph"><a class ="yhighlight" target="_blank" href="./labs/lab02/index.html">This was first basic form of my recipe page's CSS.</a> This was when I decided on the page's general appearance going forward.<br><br> One thing I learned here was that I could use semi-opaque hex code colors (i.e. translucent, with alpha channel values) to help keep my colors co-ordinated. </p>
    <a href = "./labs/lab02/index.html" target="_blank"><img class="sidepic" src ="images/lab_02.png" alt ="Thumbnail image of the first draft of my recipe page's CSS."></a>

        <br><p class = "sideparagraph"><a class ="yhighlight" target="_blank" href="./labs/lab03/index.html">This was when I first added images to my recipe page's layout.</a> I made a graphic logo heading for the website so that it looked more like a traditional cooking website. <br><br>I was able to use CSS to adjust the exact crop dimensions for the top image. I was also able to figure out how to use CSS to make the main potato salad image resize to fit the precise image size that I needed. </p>

        <h3><a id="04">LAB 04: Page Layout</a></h3>
        <br><p class = "sideparagraph"><a class ="yhighlight" target="_blank" href="./labs/lab04/index.html">This was my first time using CSS Grid for my recipe page's layout.</a> I learned a lot of things from this part of the project.<br><br> I focused on using just grid columns for this page, since I found that the page was simple enough that it didn't need rows, yet. This was the point where I got more familiar with using container tags and grid lines to visually orient elements on the page.</p>

I used Filezilla to transfer it to the main classroom site. It's since been replaced by my <a href="./index.html" class ="yhighlight" target="_blank">homepage index</a>, but there's still a copy here. </p>
