    <p class="reviewtext">Yellow Submarine (1968) is a widely influential animated jukebox musical surrealist comedy adventure starring a fictionalized version of the Beatles. It's one of my favorite films of all time. I love it for its unconventional structure, idiosyncratic visuals, historical significance, and quirky charm.</p>
    <p class="reviewtext">When Yellow Submarine burst onto the animation scene in the late 60s, it was notably bold and experimental. Unlike its contemporaties of the time, it was distinctly subversive, inventing animation techniques that hadn't ever been used before. It was one of the first examples of a dedicated crew of animators being allowed to (effectively) do whatever they wanted - and, it would pay off in dividends, as Yellow Submarine became a smash hit and beloved classic to both Animation and Music fans, alike.</p>
    <p class="reviewtext">Yellow Submarine would later go on to influence many further works. Some of these works include: Monty Python, Pink Floyd's The Wall, and The Simpsons. An <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/nov/19/beatles-yellow-submarine-simpsons-shrek">article on The Guardian</a> lists further examples. Fan blog <a href="https://kylelovesanimationnmore.wordpress.com/2018/04/07/yellow-submarine-an-animation-thesis/">Kyle Loves Animation and More</a> has an article elaborating on several of the film's notable animation techniques and history, as well. </p>
    <p class="reviewtext">One thing I've always found very amusing about Yellow Submarine's history was that the Beatles had virtually no creative input on the film itself. They were totally disinterested in its production, having been disappointed by a previous animation project. Then, only later and upon watching it, did they realize that the film was one of their favorite Beatles-branded works of all time!</p>
