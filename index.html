            <li>3 Tbsp dill pickle juice <i>(total)</i></li>
            <li>1 Tbsp yellow mustard</li>

            <li>1/2 - 1 Tsp kosher salt</li>
            <li>3 hard-boiled eggs <i>(chopped)</i></li>
            <li>1/2 cup mayonnaise <i>(ideally Hellmans, and preferably not light)</i></li>
            <li>1/4 cup full fat 14% sour cream</li>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Peel and dice the potatoes into roughly 3/4 inch pieces.</li>
        <li>Boil until tender in well salted water. Drain.</li>
        <li>Mix 2 Tbsp pickle juice with the yellow mustard. While the potatoes are still warm, spread the potatoes on a cookie sheet and drizzle the pickle juice/mustard mixture overtop. Stir gently to coat all the potatoes.</li>
        <li>Refrigerate around 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Combine all other ingredients except the eggs in a bowl large enough to contain the potato salad. Don't forget the third Tbsp of pickle juice.</li>
        <li>Fold in the potatoes and then the eggs gently and chill for around one hour. Serve and enjoy.</li>
    </ol>

        <p>I found <a href ="https://glebekitchen.com/best-potato-salad/">this recipe</a> on <a href="https://glebekitchen.com/">Glebe Kitchen.</a> It's a modified version of <a href="https://www.americastestkitchen.com/recipes/3007-all-american-potato-salad">an older recipe</a> from America's Test Kitchen. It's my favorite side dish to make, and I usually prepare it in advance and divvy out portions for lunch. I make it once every two weeks, or so. The effort-to-result ratio is pretty good; it's simple, easy, and only somewhat labor intensive. It tastes great, relative to the amount of work put in. It doesn't require too much babysitting, beyond preparing the potatoes. I make this thing in large quantities, and in our household, it lasts the better part of a few days.</p>

        <h3>Notes</h3>

        <ul>
        <li>Glebe Kitchen's recipe calls for 2 finely minced regular-sized dill pickles. I replace them with 5 finely minced mini dill gherkins for my mine, since that's what I usually have on hand.</li>
        </ul>
