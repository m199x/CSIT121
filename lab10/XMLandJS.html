<h2>What is XML?</h2>

<p>XML means eXtensible Markup Language; it is a markup language that is designed to store and transmit data. It's similar to HTML, but one key difference is that the tags in XML are self-defined. The structure of XML is defined within its own code. XML can be transmitted across different systems and programming languages because it is standardized.</p>

<h2>How is XML used?</h2>

<p>XML is used for storing and retrieving data, formatting documents, efficient web searching, storing the configuration data for programs, and more! It's broadly usable for many different programming and web development applications.</p>

<h2>What does XML look like?</h2>

<p>Here is a simple example of XML. In this case, it is being used to store basic data about films.</p>

<h2>What is JavaScript?</h2>

<p>JavaScript is a scripting language that allows the programmer to do things on web pages that wouldn't be possible with HTML and CSS alone. Webpages with only HTML and CSS are "static", while web page with complex features implemented with JavaScript are "dynamic". This refers to how content updates and changes in real time. JavaScript also allows the user access to useful programming features like storing values inside variables and operations on strings.</p>

<h2>How is Javascript related to HTML and CSS?</h2>

<p> HTML is the skeleton of a webpage and its content, while CSS changes how the content looks on the page. Javascript controls and alters the behavior of these components. </p>

<h2>What are some common JavaScript elements, properties, methods, and functions?</h2>

<ul>
<li>this</li>
<li>for</li>
<li>let</li>
<li>return</li>
<li>const</li>
<li>username</li>
<li>toString()</li>
</ul>
